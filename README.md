# Tekken7FrameData

This project aims to provide a dynamic csv file of all frame data. All the of the frame data is being pulled from
http://rbnorway.org. So thank you to all the guys at RB Norway for all the hard work collecting data and making it
available to the community for free.

 ##### Known Issues
 * Julia and Negan's frame data unavailable
    * Once RBN make the data available I will add support
 * Export only works in split mode
